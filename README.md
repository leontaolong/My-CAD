# My CAD System

This module is a very simple responsive CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawing program using a Model-View-Controller architecture and Canvas feature in HTML5. Someone could theoretically use the web application to design the architecture of a block house or something of similar scale. It allows the user to dynamically adjust the model being designed through multiple different views, thereby supporting different modes of interaction.
